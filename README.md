## About the author

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a French student, studying computer science engineering at ISIMA, France. 
I made this wrapper because I found boresome to have to create a display function for each menu's page, but I ended 
up going a little further in it. I hope you will enjoy using it, if you have any comment or advice, do not feel shy 
and tell me (by posting an issue [here](https://github.com/Klevh/SANDAL2/issues/new)) ! I will really appreciate it.

## To Install/Uninstall On Linux

Regardless the way you install SANDAL2, you'll need to include SANDAL2.h and use `-lm -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_image` compilation flags.

### I. Using the Debian Package

Installing :
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
sudo wget https://github.com/Klevh/SANDAL2/raw/master/downloadable/sandal2.deb
sudo dpkg -i sandal2.deb
```
Then you'll need to add `-lSANDAL2` as a compilation flag before all the SDL2 flags.

Uninstalling :
```
dpkg --purge sandal2
```

If the package is not made for your computer, you can download the [github project](https://github.com/Klevh/SANDAL2/), go into the directory downloaded and do those commands.
```
make
make package
sudo make install
Ì€``

### II. Using the source code

```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
```
Then, you need to compile all .c files.
