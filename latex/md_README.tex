S\+A\+N\+D\+A\+L2 is a S\+D\+L2 wrapper which purpose is to make object managment and graphic display easier.

To generate the Doxygen documentation, use the command\+: {\ttfamily doxygen Doxyfile} ~\newline
 To see this read me file with a better display, you can go to \href{https://klevh.github.io/SANDAL2/}{\tt this project\textquotesingle{}s website}. \subsection*{About the author}

~~~~~~I am a French student, studying computer science engineering at I\+S\+I\+MA, France. I made this wrapper because I found boresome to have to create a display function for each menu\textquotesingle{}s page, but I ended up going a little further in it. I hope you will enjoy using it, if you have any comment or advice, do not feel shy and tell me ! I will really appreciate it.

\subsection*{To Install}

To use S\+A\+N\+D\+A\+L2, you will have to install S\+D\+L2, S\+D\+L2\+\_\+image and S\+D\+L2\+\_\+ttf.

\subsubsection*{I. On Linux}

\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} sudo apt-\/get install libsdl2-\/dev sudo apt-\/get install libsdl2-\/image-\/dev sudo apt-\/get install libsdl2-\/ttf-\/dev \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}

\subsubsection*{II. Other OS}

~~~~~~I honestly tried to sum up how to do but I did not succeed. You should search on the internet, some guys made it way clearer than I can possibly do.

\subsection*{Functionnality}

\subsubsection*{I. To begin with}

~~~~~~To begin with, you\textquotesingle{}ll have to initialise S\+D\+L2 with init\+All\+S\+D\+L2 for image, ttf and S\+D\+L2, or one of the specific function in \hyperlink{SANDAL2_8h}{S\+A\+N\+D\+A\+L2.\+h}. Do not forget to close the S\+D\+L2 with either close\+All\+S\+D\+L2 or one or more functions in \hyperlink{SANDAL2_8h}{S\+A\+N\+D\+A\+L2.\+h} (use the closing version for every opening you made).

~~~~~~Then you\textquotesingle{}ll want to create a window (or more). For that, use the init\+Window\+S\+D\+L2 function. Then you can add elements in it with all the create functions in \hyperlink{ElementSDL2_8h}{Element\+S\+D\+L2.\+h} like create\+Block or create\+Entry\+Image for example. We will see later what you can do with all those elements more in details.

~~~~~~For the event management, you can bind functions to elements which will be called in the functions we will speak about right now when specific conditions are met. You will not have to look when you touch an element or what function to call when a key is pressed as long as you binded the right function and defined its clickable zone. For that, use functions like click\+Window\+S\+D\+L2 or key\+Pressed\+Window\+S\+D\+L2. When you want to update all your elements and the current window, use update\+Window\+S\+D\+L2. For displaying, use display\+Window\+S\+D\+L2. If you want to do that for every single window, use the \textquotesingle{}all\textquotesingle{} version like display\+All\+Window\+S\+D\+L2 or unclick\+All\+Window\+S\+D\+L2. Then again, do not forget to close your windows with close\+Window\+S\+D\+L2 or close\+All\+Window\+S\+D\+L2. Those functions are in \hyperlink{SANDAL2_8h}{S\+A\+N\+D\+A\+L2.\+h}.

~~~~~~If you want to iterate through all the windows, you can use init\+Iterator\+Window\+S\+D\+L2 and next\+Window\+S\+D\+L2. You can also get and set informations about the window with all the functions in \hyperlink{WindowSDL2_8h}{Window\+S\+D\+L2.\+h}. There they are also functions to get informations about the current window such as its ID, its position and its size.

\subsubsection*{II. Element manipulations}

~~~~~~An element is kind of an object with lots of display informations. It can have an image, a text or/and a color (for rectangles). As said higher, they can be created with functions like create\+Block or create\+Button for example. Once created, you can modifie all informations about them. They have the following informations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item coordinates in the window;
\item dimensions;
\item a collection of display code, each display code has a plan;
\item a collection of clickable zone;
\item functions bind on it to be called for certain event (they will be listed later);
\item a collection of animations;
\item a collection of elements which can be modified by the parent\textquotesingle{}s element;
\item a rotation speed;
\item a rotation (the current angle of the element);
\item a package of data (void $\ast$);
\item a package of informations if the element is a prompt. ~\newline
~\newline
 ~~~~~~The functions that can be bind to the element are the following ones\+:
\item action, to be called every update;
\item key\+Press, to be called when a key is pressed;
\item key\+Released, to be called when a key is released;
\item click, to be called if the element is clicked (be careful, there have to be a clickable zone);
\item un\+Click, to be called when the user release the click of the mouse on the clickable zone of the element;
\item un\+Select, to be called when the user click elsewhere or unclick elsewhere;
\item end\+Sprite, to be called when an animation reach its end, before starting of again. ~\newline
~\newline
 ~~~~~~You can bind elements to another (which will become their parent) so that the parent element will be able to modifie them in one of the functions you binded to it. In those function, you can modifie the element itself or others, even removing them. Each animation of an element has a code so that you can switch from one to another. When you want to add a step to the animation, you will have to define its coordinates in the image of the element (which should be a sprite sheet or something the like). Each sprite has a lifespan, which correspond to the number of update call before going to the next. That is if the animation is on \textquotesingle{}automatic\textquotesingle{} mode. The mode can be set with the function set\+Way\+Animation\+Element\+S\+D\+L2. If there are no sprite, the entire image will be displaied.~\newline
